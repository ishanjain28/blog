My name is **Ishan Jain** and I am an UnderGraduate Student in India. I've been programming for the past 6 years and absolutely love building stuff. I did Front End Web Development for a short period of about a year but didn't liked it. So, I switched my focus towards *Backend* and *Computer Graphics* and I am glad I made this choice. I also like to study, solve puzzle and build stuff related to fields like *Computer Graphics*, *Cryptography* and *Image Processing*. 

My go to languages are Rust or Go. 

This site as of now isn't updated too often as I am preparing for some exams but hopefully that'll change soon.

Have a nice day.
